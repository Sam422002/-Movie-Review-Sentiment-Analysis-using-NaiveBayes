üé¨ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes
A machine learning project to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative sentiment using the classic Naive Bayes family of algorithms.

üåü Project Overview
This project implements a text classification pipeline to perform binary sentiment analysis on the IMDB 50k Movie Reviews Dataset. The pipeline involves thorough text preprocessing, feature extraction using Bag-of-Words (Count Vectorization), and evaluation of three distinct Naive Bayes classifiers: Multinomial, Bernoulli, and Gaussian.

The best-performing model, Multinomial Naive Bayes, achieved an accuracy of over 85%.


üõ†Ô∏è Technology and Libraries
Language: Python

Core Libraries:

pandas, numpy: Data manipulation.

re, nltk: Text preprocessing (cleaning, stemming, stopword removal).

scikit-learn: Machine learning (vectorization, model training, evaluation).

joblib: Model persistence.










üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes the IMDB 50k Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains 50,000 highly polarized reviews for training and testing.

Source: /kaggle/input/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/IMDB Dataset.csv

Features (X): review (text of the movie review).

Target (Y): sentiment, which was encoded as 1 for positive and 0 for negative.

Data Split: 80% (40,000 reviews) for training and 20% (10,000 reviews) for testing.








‚öôÔ∏è Methodology and PipelineThe sentiment analysis process follows these sequential steps:Data Loading: The CSV data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.Preprocessing: A multi-step cleaning process is applied to the review text:Remove HTML tags (e.g., <br />).Lowercasing all text.Remove special characters and replace them with spaces.Remove English stopwords (e.g., 'the', 'a', 'is').Apply Porter Stemming (e.g., 'running' $\rightarrow$ 'run', 'reviews' $\rightarrow$ 'review').Feature Extraction: The preprocessed, tokenized reviews are converted into a numerical feature matrix using CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words). This resulted in $\mathbf{73,392}$ unique features.Model Training: Three Naive Bayes models were trained on the count-vectorized data.Evaluation: Model performance was assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

The Gaussian Naive Bayes model performed poorly, which is typical when applied to sparse, count-based features.



üöÄ How to Use the ModelThe trained models and the fitted CountVectorizer are saved using joblib. To predict the sentiment of a new review, you must load these assets and apply the exact same preprocessing pipeline used during training.Saved Assetsmultinomial_nb_model.pkl (The best model)bernoulli_nb_model.pklcountvectorizer.pkl (Crucial for transforming new text)Steps to Predict on New DataLoad the countvectorizer.pkl and multinomial_nb_model.pkl using joblib.load().Apply the full text preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming) to your new review text.Use the loaded CountVectorizer.transform() method to convert the preprocessed text into a numerical feature vector.Call model.predict() on the resulting feature vector to get the sentiment (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
